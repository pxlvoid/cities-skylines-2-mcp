# CS2MCP — An MCP Server for Cities: Skylines II

**English** | [简体中文](README.CHS.md)

Give Claude (or any MCP client) **full control** over a running Cities: Skylines II game: read city data, drive the camera and take screenshots, build roads and buildings, paint zones, manage finances and policies, and control simulation time.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code / Claude Desktop (any MCP client)
      │  MCP (stdio)
      ▼
cs2-mcp  (mcp-server/, Node.js process)
      │  HTTP, localhost-only 127.0.0.1:8642
      ▼
CS2MCP bridge mod  (CS2MCP.Bridge/, inside the game process)
      │  all ECS reads/writes run on the simulation main thread
      ▼
Cities: Skylines II
```

- **In-game mod** (C#): runs a minimal HTTP server on a `TcpListener` bound to 127.0.0.1 inside the game process. Requests are queued by listener threads and executed on the simulation main thread by an ECS system registered at `SystemUpdatePhase.UIUpdate` (works while paused). Construction goes through a custom `ToolBaseSystem` using the game's native definition/validation/apply pipeline; demolition goes through the bulldozer pipeline — no entity mutations that bypass game validation.
- **MCP server** (TypeScript): translates MCP tool calls into HTTP requests against the bridge mod, over stdio transport.

## Requirements

- Windows + Cities: Skylines II (Steam)
- .NET SDK 8.0+ (to build the mod)
- Node.js 18+ (to run the MCP server)

## Build & Install

```powershell
# 1. Build the in-game mod (auto-deploys to the game's local Mods folder)
dotnet build CS2MCP.Bridge\CS2MCP.Bridge.csproj

# 2. Build the MCP server
cd mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
```

The mod deploys to `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\Mods\CS2MCP\` and loads automatically on game start — no Paradox Mods publishing required. To disable it temporarily, rename the folder to `.CS2MCP`.

### Game path configuration

Building the mod references assemblies from the game folder. Resolution order (first match wins):

1. Command line: `dotnet build -p:GamePath="X:\...\Cities Skylines II"`
2. **`CS2_PATH`** environment variable
3. `CSII_INSTALLATIONPATH` environment variable (set by the official modding toolchain)
4. Auto-probing of common Steam library locations (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`, `Steam` / `SteamLibrary` on common drive letters)

If the game cannot be found the build fails with a clear error. Example:

```powershell
setx CS2_PATH "D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Cities Skylines II"
```

### Runtime environment variables (.env supported)

The MCP server loads `mcp-server/.env` via [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Scope | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CS2_BRIDGE_URL` | MCP server | `http://127.0.0.1:8642` | Address of the bridge mod |
| `CS2MCP_PORT` | game process | `8642` | Bridge listen port (change both together) |
| `CS2_PATH` | build time | auto-probed | Game install folder |

## Using with Claude

**Claude Code**: [.mcp.json](.mcp.json) in the repository root registers the `cs2` server — just open Claude Code in the project directory (it asks for trust on first use). To register from another directory:

```powershell
claude mcp add cs2 -- node <repo-path>\mcp-server\dist\index.js
```

**Claude Desktop** (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cs2": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["<repo-path>\\mcp-server\\dist\\index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Start the game, load a save, then ask Claude: "How are my city's finances?", "Zone a residential area by the river", "Build a road connecting the industrial area to the highway".

## Troubleshooting

- **`cs2_ping` unreachable**: the mod is not loaded. Check `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\Logs\CS2MCP.log` (should contain `bridge listening on ...`); if the file is missing, check `Player.log` in the same folder.
- **409 no city loaded**: still in the main menu — load a save first.
- **Lock states look wrong**: unpause briefly once after loading (lock-related endpoints return a `stalenessWarning` until the simulation has ticked).
- **Port conflict**: set `CS2MCP_PORT` for the game process and update `CS2_BRIDGE_URL` in `.env` to match.

## Known Limitations / Roadmap

- Map tile purchasing, transit line planning and terraforming are not implemented yet (planned for v0.9)
- Ramps can only connect at segment endpoints (nodes); mid-segment smooth merges are not supported yet
- Screenshots capture the game's current rendering: with a road-tool panel open the game renders roads in white outline mode
